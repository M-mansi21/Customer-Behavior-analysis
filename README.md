# Customer-Behavior-analysis
data analyst project showcasing customer shopping analysis using python , SQL , power-bi
Project Overview
This project is a real-world, end-to-end Data Analyst workflow built on a Retail Customer Behavior and Shopping Trends dataset.
It mirrors how data analysts work in actual organizations — from raw, messy data to business insights and executive dashboards.
The goal of this project is not just analysis, but solving real business problems, documenting findings, and presenting insights in a professional, stakeholder-ready format.
This project is designed to strengthen my portfolio and demonstrate job-ready data analytics skills.
